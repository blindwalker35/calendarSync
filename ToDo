To do list:
-Logger
-Make the OpenAir object types be enumerated - this will simplify the OPERATION_TYPE mappings.
-What should be the logic for getEvents with OPERATION_TYPE booking request?
	-The problem is that we would have to look up the user, iterate through the range of dates between START_DATE and END_DATE, and check all bookings for that user on each day
		-This logic is what lead to the requirement of making batch requests

To do list:
-Logout functionality? Pretty low on priority
-If batch requests goes over the CSConstants limit, start generating a second (or more) request to send out.
-Duplicate event checks in setEvents method
	-Implementation begun with uniqueid field added to CSEvent object
-Configurable calendar notifications
	-for example, 2 week notification prior to event ending
-See if you can pull up resources under a certain manager
-Calendar updates - resync if event is out of date or has been updated recently
-Caching
	-Would have to do local file based caching first (maybe JSON or XML file)
	-Eventually want to move cache to memory when application is deployed to server and persists.
		-Maybe even when application is deployed to server, on application shutdown have it export to a file and load up on startup?
		-Have option to delete / refresh cache - shouldn't need it with a proper cache check when settings events, but useful option for the possibility of a cache miss.
-UI!!

Potential Bottlenecks:
-When making requests to OpenAir to pull down bookings, the current method is pulling ALL bookings for a user, then applying a filter locally on the client.
	-If possible, want to apply filter server side to reduce traffic incoming to the client.
	
Feature List:
-JIRA ticket integration? Maybe create google calendar events for tickets and their due dates
-Add an option to allow specific set and gets - for example, have code specific to when openair pushes events to google rather than just have CSEvents be the intermediate format
-Add configuration options
	-Map certain events to certain calendars - based on some calendar mapping attribute?

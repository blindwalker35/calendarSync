To do list:
-Logger
-Logout functionality? Pretty low on priority
-If batch requests goes over the CSConstants limit, start generating a second (or more) request to send out.
-Duplicate event checks in setEvents method

Potential Bottlenecks:
-When making requests to OpenAir to pull down bookings, the current method is pulling ALL bookings for a user, then applying a filter locally on the client.
	-If possible, want to apply filter server side to reduce traffic incoming to the client.
